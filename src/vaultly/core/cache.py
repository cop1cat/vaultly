"""Thread-safe TTL cache keyed by resolved secret path.

Also exposes `KeyedLocks` — a small helper that hands out a distinct
`threading.Lock` per cache key, so concurrent fetches of the same secret
on cold cache do not stampede the backend.

TTL semantics:
  * `ttl=None`   — entry never expires.
  * `ttl=0`      — entry is stored with `expires == now`, so the next `get`
                   treats it as expired and misses. Equivalent to "no cache".
  * `ttl > 0`    — entry expires `ttl` seconds after insertion.

`get` and `peek_expired` differ only in how they treat expired entries: the
former raises `KeyError` and evicts; the latter returns the stale value (used
by `stale_on_error`).

    Used to serialize concurrent backend fetches of the same secret on cold
    cache (the "thundering herd" — N readers hit the backend N times instead
    of once).

    Reentrant by design: a non-reentrant `Lock` would deadlock if a user's
    `transform=` callable calls back into the model's `refresh` for the same
    key. With `RLock`, the recursive acquire succeeds and the user gets
    runtime semantics they can debug, not a hang. (Pure `transform`
    callables remain the recommended discipline.)

    Locks accumulate as you fetch new keys. For most apps the set of resolved
    paths is bounded by model shape and this is fine. If your `{var}`
    interpolations spray across many distinct values (multi-tenant systems
    keying by `tenant_id`, etc.), call `discard(key)` when you know a key is
    dead, or `clear()` at the appropriate boundary, to release the locks.
